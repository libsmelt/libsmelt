This folder contains some of Stefan's shell scripts. These can be
useful, and are sometimes needed, when parsing sk_m output and
generating plots.

They also deal with recording log-files (to ~/logs), which is assumed
by some of the benchmark scripts.

Please add your own scripts as a separate folder here, if needed.
